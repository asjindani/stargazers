                    <h1>Mercury</h1>
                    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun, with a surface marked by extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from blistering heat to frigid cold. Its surface is heavily cratered and lacks a substantial atmosphere, making it a harsh and inhospitable environment for humans. Mercury's proximity to the Sun makes it challenging to explore, but missions like NASA's MESSENGER have provided valuable insights into this rocky, barren world.</p>
